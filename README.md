# Create Your First Python Program

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the "Create Your First Python Program From UST" course on Coursera, where I successfully created my first Python program.

## Features
- *Python Basics:* The project demonstrates the fundamental principles of Python, including syntax, functions, and variable management.
- *Task Management:* I implemented a To-Do List that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.
- *User Interaction:* The program accepts user input to interactively manage the task list.

## Challenges Faced
- *Program Design:* Structuring the data and storing tasks within the list.
- *Error Handling:* Managing empty values and unexpected inputs during program execution.

## Tools and Technologies
- *Python:* The main programming language used in this project.
- *Terminal:* For running the Python script.
- *Text Editor:* Visual Studio Code was used for writing and editing the code.
 Python program:
   bash
## Future Improvements
- *Expand Functionality:* Add features such as task prioritization and deadline management.
- *Improve UI:* Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
